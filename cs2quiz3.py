#Section 1: Terminology
# 1) What is a recursive function?
# base case - doesn't do anything
#calling it again - 
#
# 2) What happens if there is no base case defined in a recursive function?
#The function won't do work at all
#
#
# 3) What is the first thing to consider when designing a recursive function?
#To define a function
#
#
# 4) How do we put data into a function call?
#by input
# 
# 5) How do we get data out of a function call?
#by return
#
#

#Section 2: Reading
# Read the following function definitions and function calls.
# Then determine the values of the variables q1-q20.

#a1 = 1 + (2,5)
#a2 = 1 + (6,2-1) or 1 + (6,1)
#a3 = -1

#b1 = 2
#b2 = 0
#b3 = -2

#c1 = -2
#c2 = 4 +2 =4da,m
#c3 =

#d1 = 6
#d2 = 1 + (6)
#d3 = (4, 2, 1

#Section 3: Programming
#Write a script that asks the user to enter a series of numbers.
#When the user types in nothing, it should return the average of all the odd numbers
#that were typed in. 
#In your code for the script, add a comment labeling the base case  on the line BEFORE the base case.
#Also add a comment label BEFORE the recursive case.
#It is NOT NECESSARY to print out a running total with each user input.

def odd():
	n = raw_input("Next number: ")
	if n/2 == false 
	else: 
		abs(float(odd))

def average():
	n = odd()
	if n == abs(float(odd))
		return
	if n == "":
		return average
